As a result of this lesson, I can open images files(.png, .jpg) with the help of the
CV2 library and the matplot library. Putting the image file into a variable first, with the help
of cv2 library doing the jobs of converting it into a compatible type to python. And with the
help of matplot, a visualization library who's main job was to visualize different stuff using
python.
